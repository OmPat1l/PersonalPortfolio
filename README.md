# PersonalPortfolio

you can visit my website at ompatil.site

This site broadly consists of 7 segments
*Hero Section

*Interests

*Storyline

*Skills

*Projects

*Profile, footer, and personal details

And the most exciting one, 
* Live chat with Tawk to API (Unlimited chats with file sharing, reactions and much more!!)
(it supports live chat with the admin, if the admin is offline you can simply drop a message, I will get to it whenever i will be On)

The tech stack used here includes 
HTML,CSS and a bit of JS

I have included JS in the index file itself
(most of which are template codes that I have optimized for this project)

CSS files are named as per their respective page segments.

This site is linked to my other projects 
*MindSpark Campus Ambassador
*MindSpark Monday
*Induction Website

This project also includes a feedback form, which is further integrated to netlify for collecting form responses.
Additionally, this page is connected to my blog site landing page.

to host my page locally, just clone my repo and its ready to use!
