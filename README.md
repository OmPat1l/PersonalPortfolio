# PersonalPortfolio
This site broadly consists of 6 segments
1)Hero Section
2)Interests
3)Storyline
4)Skills
5)Projects
6)Profile, footer, and personal details

The tech stack used here includes 
HTML,CSS and a bit of JS

I have included JS in the index file itself
(most of which are template codes that I have optimized for this project)

CSS files are named as per their respective page segments.

This site is linked to my other projects 
1)MindSpark Campus Ambassador
2)MindSpark Monday
3)Induction Website

This project also includes a feedback form, which is further integrated to netlify for collecting form responses.
Additionally, this page is connected to my blog site landing page.

to host my page locally, just clone my repo and its ready to use
(in case one needs my blogsite as well, you can clone it from my other repo and include thode files in same folder and run)
